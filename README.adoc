This guide walks you through the process of deploying a "hello world" Spring application to Cloud Foundry from Spring Tool Suite.

== What you'll deploy to Cloud Foundry

You'll deploy a Spring application to Cloud Foundry that will accept HTTP GET requests at:

    https:///gs-spring-sts-cf-deployment.cfapps.io:8080/greeting

and respond with a web page displaying a greeting:

    "Hello, World!"

You can customize the greeting with an optional `name` parameter in the query string:

    https:///gs-spring-sts-cf-deployment.cfapps.io:8080/greeting?name=User

The `name` parameter value overrides the default value of "World" and is reflected in the response:

    "Hello, User!"
    
This application is based on an Spring service that serves web content. Further information on how to create the service from scratch can be found at
{gs-serving-web-content}[Serving Web Content with Spring MVC], or it can be imported into STS through the Getting Started Guide Import Wizard.


== What you'll need

 - About 15 minutes
 - http://spring.io/tools/sts/all[Spring Tool Suite (STS)]
 - {jdk}[JDK 7] or later
 - http://docs.run.pivotal.io/starting/index.html#signup[Pivotal Web Services (PWS) account]
 - Cloud Foundry Eclipse


== Installing STS
If you don't have STS installed yet, visit the link up above. From there, you can download a copy for your platform. To install it simply 
unpack the downloaded archive.

When you're done, go ahead and launch STS.

== Installing Cloud Foundry Eclipse
If you are using STS version 3.6.3 or higher, Cloud Foundry Eclipse comes pre-installed, and you can skip this step. Otherwise, in STS, go to Window -> Install New Software.

In the Install dialogue, enter the following software installation URL for Cloud Foundry Eclipse:

http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/cloudfoundry

Select the plug-in from the list and continue with the wizard until completion.

After Cloud Foundry Eclipse is installed, you will have to restart STS.


== Creating a Server Instance to Cloud Foundry

With Cloud Foundry Eclipse installed, you must first create a representation of the Cloud space target where you would like to deploy
your application too. This is known as a "server instance" in the Eclipse Web Tools Platform framework, which Cloud Foundry Eclipse 
contributes to. To create a Cloud Foundry server instance, open the Eclipse Servers view from the Window -> Show View menu, right-click on the view and select:

New -> Server

Select Cloud Foundry under "Pivotal", and either keep the default server instance name or enter a new one.

Go to the next page and enter your username and password for your Pivotal Web Services account. Note that http://docs.run.pivotal.io/starting/index.html#signup[you must have an 
account registered] as a prerequisite to deploying your application to PWS.

Navigate to the following page, which will automatically attempt to validate your credentials. The subsequent page will display
the organizations and spaces in your account. Select the target space for your deployment. In this guide we select a deployment 
space.

Click "Finish" to complete the server instance creation, which will then show in the Servers view.




== Create a Spring Serving-Web-Content Application

Now we will deploy a Spring application that serves web content. In STS, open the "Import Spring Getting Started Content" wizard:

image::images/import_gsg.png[Import Getting Started]

In the search field, enter "sts" and the sts-cloud-foundry-deployment guide should appear. The wizard may take a few
moments to download the content for the guide. Once the download is completed:

- Select the build type.
- Select the "default" code set.
- Click "Finish".

The import wizard will create a new project in your workspace called "sts-cloud-foundry-deployment".


== Deploying to Cloud Foundry





== Test the service

Now that the web site is running on Cloud Foundry, visit https:///gs-spring-sts-cf-deployment.cfapps.io:8080/greeting
, where you see:

    "Hello, World!"

Provide a `name` query string parameter with https:///gs-spring-sts-cf-deployment.cfapps.io:8080/greeting
?name=User. Notice how the message changes from "Hello, World!" to "Hello, User!":

    "Hello, User!"

This change demonstrates that the {RequestParam}[`@RequestParam`] arrangement in `GreetingController` is working as expected. The `name` parameter has been given a default value of "World", but can always be explicitly overridden through the query string.


== Summary

Congratulations! You have just developed a web page using Spring.
